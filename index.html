      <h1>Welcome</h1>
      <p>Lake Pleasant RV Park is a family-owned and operated RV Park for nearly 20 years.
        With commitment to quality and excellence, it is our mission to provide a safe,
        beautiful and well-maintained property for our long-term residents, seasonal
        visitors and short-term guests. It is our duty to provide unparalleled customer
        service combined with the finest offering of RV resorts, amenities, and activities
        for you and your family to enjoy the great outdoors of western Washington.</p>
      <p>Our lovely park includes a wildlife habitat and small lake filled with fish and waterfowl.
        All sites are within a short walking distance to the small lake and many are waterfront.
        Watch the ducks and cranes, listen to the bullfrogs and enjoy our lawns and trees.
        We're the perfect spot to jump off to wine tasting and dining in Woodinville or exploring
        Seattle attractions and museums. We have wooded nature trails, a putting/chipping green, and
        access to paved bike trails that lead to downtown Seattle. Explore the Northwest then come home
        to a greenbelt haven. We do fill up in summer, so please book your site early. We welcome all rigs
         - big or small.</p>

          <p>I can not express enough how wonderful this place is! They go out
            of their way to make you feel like part of the family! Toni went above
            and beyond to help us out and even gave us some tips and what to do when
            the unexpected snow hit us! Thank you soooo sooo much for always having a
            smile a wave and for making us feel right at home in your beautiful park!
            I really hate to leave and I wish I could just take the whole place with us.</p>

          <p>This is one of the BEST RV parks in western Washington! It is beautifully
            surrounded by evergreens and has a many hiking trails for our pups to explore.
            There are geese and ducks everywhere! We were lucky enough to back up to the
            lake and we really enjoyed the view. The friendly management and staff went out
            of their way to make sure we felt welcomed. We would definitely stay here again!
            Thank you for a wonderful month!</p>
